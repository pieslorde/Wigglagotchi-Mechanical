# Wigglagotchi-Mechanical
This repository contains the SolidWorks 2021 source files and generated STL files for the enclosure of the
[Wigglagotchi-PCB](https://github.com/pieslorde/Wigglagotchi-PCB), an open-source handheld gaming device with
three buttons, a screen, an IMU, a buzzer, and an IrDA transceiver to communicate with other Wigglagotchis.

The namesake of the Wigglagotchi is the Twitch streamer [Keffals](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffals).
A frequent feature of her community is an [animated chibi-style version of herself
dancing](https://twitter.com/keffals/status/1509562415096213510), or wiggling. Chatters who use the emote are referred
to as "Wigglers", and the Wigglagotchi was designed to support virtual Wiggler pets for the user.

The enclosure is assembled with three small #0-80 3/8" machine screws. The prints may be dyed using alcohol
ink and the embossed text may be filled with coloured wax or resin or even primed and painted.

A drawing of the assembled device is [included in this source](https://github.com/pieslorde/Wigglagotchi-Mechanical/blob/main/wigglagotchi_v2.pdf)
including 1:1 wireframe representation and a 2:1 isometric rendering.
